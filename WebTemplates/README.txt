Place complete templates with following structure in this folder:

for templatename have a structure with that name like following:
templatename/html/
templatename/assets/

All html-files and page related stuff under html/
All the rest (images, javascript, css etc) under assets/

Under those folder deeper folder structure is possible.

Especially for assets like assets/img/, assets/js/, assets/css/
